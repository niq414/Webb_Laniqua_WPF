A Cat, a Parrot, and a Bag of Seed:
Problem:
A man cannot get to the other side of the river by boat due to the limited amount of space for him and his belongings.
The goal is for both the man, the cat, the parrot and the bag of seed to make it to the other side of the river.

The constraints are:
1. The boat will not carry all both the man and his belongings at the same time due to size
2. The parrot will eat the bag of seed
3. The cat will eat the parrot

The Sub Goals are:
1. Keep the parrot safe
2. Keep the bag of food safe

Possible Solutions:
1. Let the parrot fly alongside the boat to drop the cat off then go back for the seed with the parrot flying
2. Take a the bag of seed to one side while the parrot fly alongside and go back to get the cat

Solution 1:
The goals are meet as all items will make it to the other side of the river

Solution 2:
The goals are meet as there are no requirements stating that the parrot cannot fly.

Final Solution:

The man place the bag of seed in the boat and the bird will fly alongside him. He will drop the seed off at the other
side and go back with the parrot for the cat. The parrot will then fly alongside him again and all items and the man
will be together on the other side of the river.



Socks in the Dark:
Problem:
There are several socks in a drawer varying in color and the individual selecting the socks cannot use light until
the selection has been made.

Goal (A)
To choose a matching pair of socks

Constraints:
1. Without light it is difficult to confirm your selection.

Sub Goals:
Choose as few socks as possible
Ensure that socks are matching

Solution A:
1. Choose the total amount of socks + 1

Final Solution:
The total smallest number of socks that would need to be selected is 4. At least 4 socks would guarantee at
least 1 matching pair.

Example scenarios:
1black+1brown+1white+1brown=2brown socks
1white+1black+1white+1brown=2white socks
1black+1black+1brown+1brown=2black and 2 brown socks.
Since there are only 3 colors to pick the fourth color has to match one of the first 3 socks picked.

Goal (B)
To select at least 6 socks with 3 matches.

Constraints:
1. No light
2. There needs to be a match for all 3 colored socks.

Solution (B)
1. Select all the socks in the drawer.
2. Select all of the socks for the 2 highest quantity color of socks.

Final Solution
Pick 10(amount of black socks)+6(amount of brown socks)+2 (at least 1 pair of white socks)
At least 18 socks would guarantee one of each color
If you choose at least 7 socks then they could all the black or
You could have 6 brown socks and 1 white sock which means you wouldn't have all 3 colors
The only way to guarantee that you have 1 of each color is to add the black socks(10)+ the brown socks(6)+1
In the event that the first 16 socks are only black or brown then the last sock must be white.
