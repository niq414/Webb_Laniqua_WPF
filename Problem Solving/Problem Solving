Socks in the Dark
A:At least four socks would guarantee at least 1 matching pair.
Example scenarios:
1black+1brown+1white+1brown=2brown socks
1white+1black+1white+1brown=2white socks
1black+1black+1brown+1brown=2black and 2 brown socks.
Since there are only 3 colors to pick the fourth color has to match one of the first 3 socks picked.
