A Cat, a Parrot, and a Bag of Seed:
Problem:
A man cannot get to the other side of the river by boat due to the limited amount of space for him and his belongings.


Socks in the Dark:
Problem:
There are several socks in a drawer varying in color and the individual selecting the socks cannot use light until
the selection has been made.

A:At least four socks would guarantee at least 1 matching pair.
Example scenarios:
1black+1brown+1white+1brown=2brown socks
1white+1black+1white+1brown=2white socks
1black+1black+1brown+1brown=2black and 2 brown socks.
Since there are only 3 colors to pick the fourth color has to match one of the first 3 socks picked.

B:At least 18 socks would guarantee one of each color:
If you choose at least 7 socks then they could all the black or
You could have 6 brown socks and 1 white sock which means you wouldn't have all 3 colors
The only way to guarantee that you have 1 of each color is to add the black socks(10)+ the brown socks(6)+1
In the event that the first 16 socks are only black or brown then the last sock must be white.
